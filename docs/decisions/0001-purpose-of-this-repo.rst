1. Purpose of this Repo
=======================

Status
------

Accepted

Context
-------

The ARCHBOM team occasionally has ideas they want to try out in a production setting before releasing them to the broader
OpenEdX community. This has become particularly evident during the development of the event bus, which requires several iterations
before being ready for full release and adoption.

Decision
--------

New functionality under development by the ARCHBOM team that is not ready to be released to the OpenEdX community
will be developed in this optional plugin, which will be installed on the edX.org production servers. This will allow
the ARCHBOM teams to quickly test new ideas in a production setting with lower risk to edx-platform as a whole
and without any new requirements for the community.
