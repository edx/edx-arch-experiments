Datadog Diagnostics
###################

When installed in the LMS as a plugin app, the ``datadog_diagnostics`` app adds additional logging for debugging our Datadog integration.

This is intended as a temporary situation while we debug the `trace concatenation issue <https://github.com/edx/edx-arch-experiments/issues/692>`_.

Usage
*****

In LMS:

- Install ``edx-arch-experiments`` as a dependency
